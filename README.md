# CitationExtension
Chrome extension to cite websites

##Usage:
This extension cites the current webpage in what I think is MLA format(for 
now). I am not an expert with citation styles so use at your own risk, but I
think that it is mostly accurate. The extension will automatically gather data 
from the website and write as good of a citation as it can and automatically 
copy it to your clipboard. There is also a manual entry mode incase it misses 
or gets false infomation.

##Installation:
Use ```git clone``` to download this repository. Then open google chrome 
and go to http://chrome://extensions/. Turn on Developer mode then click 
load unpacked select this project from your files and make sure it is switched
on. 

##Updates:
As this project it updated the extension must be reloaded by going to 
http://chrome://extensions/ and reloading this extension after the new
version was downloaded. Any page that was openned before reloading this 
extension will need to be reloaded for the extension to work with them.
